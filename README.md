# Cascade Filters Plugin

This is a fork of the cascade-filters plugin. I only forked
it to include my own changes, which should not be overwritten by an eventual
update. The main goal was to use cascade plugin in the antimatter theme. However, in the process I adapted it a little bit. The changed css is not included here, so all of this is specific for my setup.

For the original plugin, please refer (and give credit) to:
<https://github.com/ash0080/grav-plugin-cascade-filters>.

Obviously, the original LICENSE.md still applies. :)
