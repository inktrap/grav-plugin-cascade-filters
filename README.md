# Cascade Filters Plugin

This is a fork of the cascade-filters plugin. I only forked
it to include my own changes, which should not be overwritten by an eventual
update.

The main goal was to use the cascade plugin in the antimatter theme. However, in the process I adapted it a little bit. Some (but not all changes e.g. css) are included here. This is specific for my needs, I guess.

For the original plugin, please refer (and give credit) to:
<https://github.com/ash0080/grav-plugin-cascade-filters>.

Obviously, the original LICENSE.md still applies. :)
